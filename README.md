This repository contains some of the scripts developed for the Physique-Numerique class held by Prof. Laurent Villard at EPFL.

The goal of this small project is to port these scripts in GPU (CPU version only has been developed in the framework of the Physique numerique class) with the fewest modifications.

The original cpu-only files were not relying on CUDA libreries but these files do even in the cpu only version and still need a GPU for running even in the cpu-only version (that exists with some flag only as a benchmark for the gpu version).

The files are nootebok (.ipynb) that can be open and run on colab.
